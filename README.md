They are so many workers in coal mines continuesly facing health issues. they don't  concentrate about health there are various factors which affect their health while working in coal mines. Some of the critical problems include breathing issues, heart attacks, due to the release of toxics gases and dust. To avoid such cases and to monitor their health status we have come up with a Wireless communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, are used to transmit data from sensors and monitoring systems in coal mines.In this all workers are given a dress code which they should follow in which we will insert the sensor system which will sense all parameters( heart rate, oxygen saturation (sp02), body temperature,air quality monitoring, gas leakage detection, room temperature, humidity levels) of the workers and also a smart alert system is being implemented  for the safety of  mine workers by alerting them at the right time to escape from the mining  environment in case of any unanticipated incidents . This system constantly observes the coalmine environment and alerts the worker and the authorized person from the ground station by using through the built in WiFi  such as ESP32. The status of the coal mine environment and health of the mineworkers will be  updated continuously in the Arduino Iot cloud.Finally, this technology provides better results of their health status there by reducing the health issues, healthcare costs, and enhance the quality of healthcare services.
